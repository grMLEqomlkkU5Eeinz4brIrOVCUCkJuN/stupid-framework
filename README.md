# The STUPID Framework

**A methodology for discovering breakthrough ideas by starting with deliberately bad ones.**
Read our [Manifesto!](./MANIFESTO.md)
> Also a coping mechanism for me to overcome the the urge of not wanting to work on a project because of how "stupid" it can be, which denies myself a learning experience.

## What is STUPID?

The STUPID Framework is a creative thinking tool that transforms seemingly ridiculous ideas into genuine innovation by forcing you to examine *why* something seems wrong and what value might hide beneath that wrongness.

---

## The Four Components

### 1. STUPID LEAP
**A deliberately "bad," absurd, or mismatched idea.**

**Prompt:** What's an idea that feels obviously wrong, useless, or unreasonable?

**Template:** *"What if we put..."*

**Example:** "What if we put a treadmill..."

---

### 2. STUPID CONTEXT
**A place, object, or situation where the idea clearly does not belong.**

**Prompt:** Where would this idea be hilariously unsuitable or totally out of place?

**Template:** *"...on/into/for..."*

**Example:** "...in a cemetery..."

---

### 3. HIDDEN VALUE
**The surprising usefulness behind the apparent stupidity.**

**Prompt:** What unexpected benefit might emerge if we ignored how wrong this seems?

**Template:** *"...so that..."*

**Example:** "...so that visitors can walk and reflect while staying present with their grief through movement..."

---

### 4. NOTABLE PROBLEMS
**The real flaws, risks, or constraints that make the idea seem stupid.**

**Prompt:** What valid criticisms make this idea look dead on arrival?

**Template:** *"...despite notable problems like..."*

**Example:** "...despite notable problems like disrespect concerns, noise, and cultural inappropriateness."

## The Complete Sentence Template

> **"What if we put [STUPID IDEA] on/into/for [STUPIDLY UNSUITABLE THING], so that [SURPRISINGLY VALUABLE OUTCOME], despite notable problems like [OBVIOUS PROBLEMS]?"**

## Doubtful of STUPID?

Throughout history, the most transformative innovations were dismissed as stupid, impractical, or impossible. The STUPID Framework helps you recognize that the visceral "this is ridiculous" reaction might be pointing toward something revolutionary.

### The Light Bulb (1878)
**STUPID:** Glowing wire in a glass bulb to replace gas lamps  
**CONTEXT:** Every home and business in the world  
**CRITICISM:** A British parliamentary committee called it "unworthy of the attention of practical or scientific men"  
**OUTCOME:** Transformed civilization

### Airplanes (1903-1911)  
**STUPID:** Heavier-than-air machines that could fly  
**CONTEXT:** Military and commercial transportation  
**CRITICISM:** A French general in 1911: "Interesting toys but of no military value"  
**OUTCOME:** Changed warfare, travel, and global connectivity forever

### The Internet/World Wide Web (1995)
**STUPID:** A global network of connected computers for everyone  
**CONTEXT:** Homes, businesses, daily life  
**CRITICISM:** Newsweek dismissed it as a fad, predicted e-commerce would fail  
**OUTCOME:** Rewired human civilization

### Personal Computers (1970s-1985)
**STUPID:** A computer in every home  
**CONTEXT:** Average people's houses (not just universities/businesses)  
**CRITICISM:** New York Times in 1985 predicted laptops' "sad demise"  
**OUTCOME:** Created the digital age

### Mobile Phones (1980)
**STUPID:** Everyone carrying a phone in their pocket  
**CONTEXT:** Daily life for average people  
**CRITICISM:** McKinsey predicted only 900,000 US users by 2000  
**ACTUAL:** 108 million users by 2000 (120x more than predicted)

### Vaccines (Late 1700s)
**STUPID:** Injecting cowpox into healthy people to prevent smallpox  
**CONTEXT:** Public health policy  
**CRITICISM:** Religious leaders and press portrayed it as "against God's will," showed cartoons of people growing cow heads  
**OUTCOME:** Eradicated smallpox, saved hundreds of millions of lives

---

### What These Have in Common

Every one of these "stupid" ideas:
1. **Violated existing paradigms** about how things should work
2. **Seemed impractical** with current infrastructure/understanding
3. **Was ridiculed by experts** who should have known better
4. **Sparked visceral rejection** (not just skepticism, but mockery)
5. **Required believing before seeing** (couldn't be proven until built)

**The STUPID Framework helps you recognize these patterns *before* history proves the skeptics wrong.**

## How to Use This Framework in a group
Not a hard and fast rule, use it however you like, just keep it to the 4 components.

### Solo Brainstorming
1. Set a timer for 5 minutes
2. Generate 10 STUPID LEAPs (intentionally bad ideas)
3. Pick the 3 most absurd ones
4. Complete the full framework for each
5. Look for the one where the Hidden Value surprises you most

### Workshop Format
1. **Round 1 (5 min):** Everyone writes STUPID LEAPs on sticky notes
2. **Round 2 (10 min):** Pass them around, add STUPID CONTEXTS
3. **Round 3 (15 min):** In pairs, find HIDDEN VALUE for the best combos
4. **Round 4 (10 min):** Reality check with NOTABLE PROBLEMS
5. **Round 5 (20 min):** Vote on most promising ideas and refine

### Innovation Audit
Use STUPID to stress-test existing ideas:
- Take a "safe" concept your team is considering
- Make it deliberately worse using STUPID LEAP + CONTEXT
- See if the HIDDEN VALUE reveals what you're actually afraid of
- Use NOTABLE PROBLEMS to surface unspoken concerns

## Why It Works

### It bypasses the inner critic
By giving yourself permission to be stupid, you disable the mental filter that kills ideas before they're fully formed.

### It reveals hidden assumptions
The absurdity forces you to articulate *why* something seems wrong, often exposing unexamined beliefs about how things "should" work.

### It creates psychological safety
When everyone's being intentionally stupid together, there's no such thing as a "bad" idea, which paradoxically leads to better ideas.

### It maps the innovation space
By exploring the extremes (the stupidest possible version), you better understand the viable middle ground where real innovation lives.

## Real-World Applications

- **Product Design:** Finding features users didn't know they needed
- **Service Innovation:** Reimagining customer experiences from scratch
- **Strategy Work:** Challenging industry assumptions
- **Problem-Solving:** Reframing stuck challenges
- **Team Building:** Creating permission to think differently

---

## Tips for Facilitators

**Do:**
- Emphasize that "stupid" means *deliberately absurd*, not *offensive*
- Encourage wild leaps, the worse the better
- Celebrate the most ridiculous combinations
- Push for specific Hidden Value, not vague benefits
- Make Notable Problems honest and unflinching

**Don't:**
- Let people self-censor during STUPID LEAP
- Accept "I don't know" for Hidden Value, dig deeper
- Skip Notable Problems to stay positive
- Dismiss ideas because they seem too stupid (that's the point)

## Example Walkthrough 1

**Challenge:** Make city parks more engaging for teenagers

**STUPID LEAP:** Install arcade machines

**STUPID CONTEXT:** In a botanical garden

**HIDDEN VALUE:** Creates an excuse for screen-addicted teens to spend time in nature, using gaming as the gateway drug to outdoor appreciation. The juxtaposition makes both activities more interesting.

**NOTABLE PROBLEMS:** Noise pollution, electricity requirements, vandalism risk, conflicts with peaceful garden atmosphere, maintenance costs, weather exposure.

**Insight:** Maybe not *arcade machines*, but what about geocaching, AR scavenger hunts, or parkour courses that gamify outdoor spaces for teens?


## Example Walkthrough 2 (but for learning)
**Challenge:** Learn how databases work at a deep level

**STUPID LEAP:** Build a production-grade distributed database

**STUPID CONTEXT:** Using only Excel spreadsheets and email

**HIDDEN VALUE:** Forces you to solve every hard database problem manually and visibly. For example: ACID transactions become literal email chains with "COMMIT" or "ROLLBACK" in the subject line, sharding becomes multiple spreadsheet files, replication means CC'ing everyone, consensus protocols become reply-all threads. Every abstraction that databases hide becomes painfully, hilariously obvious. You'd deeply understand why eventual consistency is hard, why distributed transactions are expensive, why indexes matter, and why CAP theorem isn't just theory. The stupidity makes the invisible visible.

**NOTABLE PROBLEMS:** Absurdly slow (minutes per query), no concurrency control, email has no transactional guarantees, manual conflict resolution would be nightmarish, scales to maybe 3 users before collapsing, data loss guaranteed, version conflicts everywhere, completely impractical for any real use.

**Insight:** This extreme stupidity reveals what databases actually do. When you're forced to implement two-phase commit via email, you understand why distributed databases are hard. When merge conflicts destroy your data, you understand MVCC. When sorting 10,000 rows in Excel takes 5 minutes, you understand why B-trees exist. The learning comes from experiencing the pain that good abstractions hide. Real outcome: you could actually build this as a teaching exercise so that we give students trauma and they would nevet forget how databases work.
